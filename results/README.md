# Results

This folder reports the extended version of all the results obtained across experiments. The subfolders are detailed in the following
# 50 runs_test results
The folder contains the numerical results from all 200 experiments (MAML-MTPINN), 50 for each subset of LDs (75,50,25,10). Each experiment output includes 3 random cities, for which the following values were estimated: critical density, maximum flow, offset, occupancy scaler, a1, a2, mse (norm.), rrse (norm.), corr (norm.). 
# MAML MFD
The folder contains close up of the estimated MFDs for experiments with (75,50,25,10) subsets of LDs. Each row represents one experiment, where the MFD of 3 randomly drawn cities is estimated based on the hyperparameters obtained from the training.
