# MAML for MFD

The provided code has been designed for the implementation of Model Agnostich Machine Learning to estimate the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram in data scarcity settings.
The code has been tested on the UTD19 dataset, a public source freely accessible at: https://utd19.ethz.ch/
MAML trains models to understand and adapt to new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of detectors and topological structures.The model itself is also implemented in the code under the acronym MTPINN (Multi-Task Physics Informed Neural Network), a non parametric model designed to estimate three key parameters of the MFD: the critical occupancy, the maximum flow, and the flow-occupancy relationship. MTPINN integrates Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks. More specifically, MTL leverages shared layers for common high level representations, while defining task-specific layers for the output branches. Physics-Informed regularization techniques are used to introduce domain knowledge into the MTL architecture.
